# Downloads-Organiser-Chrome-Extension

Downloads Folder is always a mess in this day and age of internet where people download a bunch of things and sometimes it gets very annoying and irritating to find a particular file. I was going through the same problem hence I developed a chrome extension which organises my Downloads folder according to the file type as soon as the download begins.

This is a chrome extension which can be installed locally.
# Installation Procedure 
Firstly Download the Repo and unzip it. Then,

1. Click the three dots in the top-right corner of the brower toolbar.
2. Click on settings.
3. Select "Extensions" from the left menu.
4. Click on "Load Unpacked".
5. Select the folder that you just downloaded.

And you're done.
